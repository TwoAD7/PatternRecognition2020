    "    * Print a nice diagram of the tree.  Make sure it is filled and all features and classes are labeled!\n",
    "    * Classify the passengers in the challenge data file\n",
    "    * Make a plot showing the challenge passengers and decision boundary.  Show the most important feature on the horizontal axis, and the second most important feature on the vertical\n",
    "    * Finally, make a csv file with your predictions.  It must have the same format and row order as the challenge data file with 2 new columns: \n",
